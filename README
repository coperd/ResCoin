DVRSF: Dynamic VirtualMachine Resource Scheduling Framework, "dvf" for short 

vm_monitor.c: program based on libvirt API to monitor the resource usage
of VMs and host(cpu, memory, disk and network), planning to treat it as
the main entry of the whole framework. DO remember to Reconstruct the code 
base after some time later.

rc.c/rc.h: virutal machine resource tuning functions

ewma.c/ewma.h: the prediction model used to predict resource workload

gmmagent.c: the agent running in each VM to collect the memory usage info
